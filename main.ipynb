    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Evaluate each {problem} and {solution} pair based on the following six criteria:\n",
    "    (a) Circularity Potential: Assess the idea's effectiveness in promoting circularity, reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency, or encouraging reuse and recycling.\n",
    "                IMPORTANT: If the solution does not promote directly circularity terminate the evaluation and assign the sentiment: Not Applicable. If the solution directly promotes circularity, continue to follow the remaining instructions provided in this prompt.\n",
    "    (b) Scalability: Evaluate the potential for the business model's broader adoption, replication, and impact across different contexts or regions.\n",
    "    (c) Innovation and Novelty: Determine the level of innovation, novelty, and disruptive potential introduced by the idea.\n",
    "    (d) Economic Viability: Analyze the economic prospects, revenue generation, profitability, and investment attractiveness of the proposed business opportunity.\n",

      "1. Circularity Potential: The \"Fashion Rental and Reselling\" business model directly promotes circularity by encouraging the reuse and reselling of clothes, thereby reducing clothing waste and extending the lifecycle of garments. It effectively addresses the disposable nature of the fast fashion industry and promotes a more sustainable approach to clothing consumption.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. Scalability: The business model has high scalability potential as it can be adopted by both large brands and smaller businesses. As more companies adopt this approach, it can lead to a substantial shift in consumer behavior, promoting a more circular and sustainable fashion industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Innovation and Novelty: The idea introduces a novel approach to addressing the environmental impact of the fashion industry by focusing on rental and reselling, which is a disruptive shift from the traditional use-and-discard culture of fast fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Economic Viability: The business model offers a steady stream of income through subscription fees or rental charges, making it economically viable. It also provides an opportunity for brands to attract customers who can't afford high-quality clothing by offering them the chance to rent or buy used clothes at lower prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Social and Environmental Impact: The idea significantly contributes to sustainability goals by reducing clothing waste, minimizing the number of clothes that end up in landfills, and promoting a more mindful and sustainable approach to clothing consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Feasibility and Implementation: The technical feasibility of the business model is high, and it aligns with the growing consumer demand for sustainable and circular fashion practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the \"Fashion Rental and Reselling\" business model demonstrates strong potential in promoting circular economy principles, with high scalability, innovation, economic viability, and significant social and environmental impact.\n",

      "Recommendation: To further improve the idea, it would be beneficial to explore partnerships with sustainable material suppliers and invest in marketing efforts to raise awareness about the environmental benefits of the rental and reselling model. Additionally, integrating technology for virtual try-on experiences and efficient logistics for rental returns could enhance the customer experience.\n"
